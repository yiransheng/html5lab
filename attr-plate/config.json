{"name":"Attribute Plate","place":"attr-plate","tags":["animation","ui","canvas"],"description":"Another migrated demo. Description I wrote back then: \"I don't really what this is called ... so I just name it as 'Attributes Plate.' I wrote a simple class plate. It is based on the object 'point', which is pretty much the same thing as the flash.geom.point class in ActionScript.\" That was almost two years ago, now I have included that point class into Sheng.js as Sheng.point, funny I am still using stuff from a long time ago.
